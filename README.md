Pointmap
========
Pointmap was an idea I had to create a mapping program on which you could plot points. This would be useful for people wishing to add lots of points, with details for each point.
Future ideas included analysis of data and the ability to search etc.
For now, this project has been terminated. I have no plans to continue it unless someone expresses interest.
